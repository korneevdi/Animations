## Description

The file **Ballistic_round** contains the code of the program that performs the animation of a projectile launched at a target. The user enters three parameters from the keyboard: the distance to the target, the height at which it is located, and the height at which the launcher is located. Consideration of the flight of a ballistic projectile in the simplest case is similar to the classical school problem of the movement of a body thrown at an angle to the horizon. In this repository, this problem is solved in Python and animation of the movement of a projectile using the **matplotlib** library is presented. The program will work in all four cases: ground-to-ground, ground-to-air, air-to-ground and air-to-air.

## Some physics

According to the laws of physics, the free movement of a body in the gravitational field of the earth can be described using kinematics equations:

$x(t) = x_0 + v_0t\cos\alpha$,

$y(t) = y_0 + v_0t\sin\alpha + \frac{at^2}{2}$,

where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are initial coordinates, $v_0$ is initial speed, $\alpha$ is the angle at which the body was thrown, $t$ is time and $a$ is acceleration. In our case, this acceleration $a = -g$, because it is the downward gravity acceleration.

We can introduce a coordinate system such that $x_0 = 0$. Since we want our projectile to hit the target, the trajectory should go through the point with coordinates $(S,H)$, which are input by the user. Then the at the final moment of time $T$ we can write:

$S = v_0T\cos\alpha$,

$H = H_0 + v_0T\sin\alpha - \frac{gT^2}{2}$.

This is a system of two equations with two unknown variables - the flight time $T$ and the initial speed $v_0$ of the projectile. We can obtain explicit expressions for both of them by solving the system of equations:

$v_0 = \frac{S}{\cos\alpha}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{g}{2(S\tan\alpha+H_0-H)}}$,

$T = \sqrt{\frac{2(S\tan\alpha+H_0-H)}{g}}$.

The formulas turn out to be cumbersome, but Python doesn't care :)

We can also solve the system of equations for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ a little differently, and then we get the dependence $y(x)$, that is, the equation for the projectile flight path:

$y(x) = H_0 + x\tan\alpha - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2\cos^2\alpha}$.

Now you can calculate the derivative $y'(x)$ of this function and equate it to zero to find the maximum height of the trajectory:

$y_{max} = H_0 + \frac{v_0^2\sin^2\alpha}{2g}$.

We need this value so that we can automatically adjust the size of the window in which the animation will be shown. So, now you can start programming!
