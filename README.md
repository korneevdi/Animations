## Description

The file **Ballistic_round** contains the code of the program that performs the animation of a projectile launched at a target. The user enters three parameters from the keyboard: the distance to the target, the height at which it is located, and the height at which the launcher is located. Consideration of the flight of a ballistic projectile in the simplest case is similar to the classical school problem of the movement of a body thrown at an angle to the horizon. In this repository, this problem is solved in Python and animation of the movement of a projectile using the **matplotlib** library is presented. The program will work in all four cases: ground-to-ground, ground-to-air, air-to-ground and air-to-air.

**Please note that this program was created solely for educational purposes in order to understand and demonstrate the capabilities of the Python matplotlib library. The author of this program exclusively supports world peace!** üòäü§ùüèª
