##Description

The file **Ballistic_round** contains the code of the program that performs the animation of a projectile launched at a target. The user enters three parameters from the keyboard: the distance to the target, the height at which it is located, and the height at which the launcher is located. Consideration of the flight of a ballistic projectile in the simplest case is similar to the classical school problem of the movement of a body thrown at an angle to the horizon. In this repository, this problem is solved in Python and animation of the movement of a projectile using the **matplotlib** library is presented.
