## Description

The file **Ballistic_round** contains the code of the program that performs the animation of a projectile launched at a target. The user enters three parameters from the keyboard: the distance to the target, the height at which it is located, and the height at which the launcher is located. Consideration of the flight of a ballistic projectile in the simplest case is similar to the classical school problem of the movement of a body thrown at an angle to the horizon. In this repository, this problem is solved in Python and animation of the movement of a projectile using the **matplotlib** library is presented. The program will work in all four cases: ground-to-ground, ground-to-air, air-to-ground and air-to-air.

## Some physics

According to the laws of physics, the free movement of a body in the gravitational field of the earth can be described using kinematics equations:

$x(t) = x_0 + v_0t\cos\alpha$,

$y(t) = y_0 + v_0t\sin\alpha + \frac{at^2}{2}$,

where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are initial coordinates, $v_0$ is initial speed, $\alpha$ is the angle at which the body was thrown, $t$ is time and $a$ is acceleration. In our case, this acceleration $a = -g$, because it is the downward gravity acceleration.

We can introduce a coordinate system such that $x_0 = 0$. Since we want our projectile to hit the target, the trajectory should go through the point with coordinates $(S,H)$, which are input by the user. Then the at the final moment of time $T$ we can write:

$S = v_0T\cos\alpha$,

$H = H_0 + v_0T\sin\alpha - \frac{gT^2}{2}$.

This is a system of two equations with two unknown variables - the flight time $T$ and the initial speed $v_0$ of the projectile. We can obtain explicit expressions for both of them by solving the system of equations:

$v_0 = \frac{S}{\cos\alpha}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{g}{2(S\tan\alpha+H_0-H)}}$,

$T = \sqrt{\frac{2(S\tan\alpha+H_0-H)}{g}}$.

The formulas turn out to be cumbersome, but Python doesn't care :)

We can also solve the system of equations for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ a little differently, and then we get the function $y(x)$, that is, the equation for the projectile flight trajectory:

$y(x) = H_0 + x\tan\alpha - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2\cos^2\alpha}$.

Now you can calculate the derivative $y'(x)$ of this function and equate it to zero to find the maximum height of the trajectory:

$y_{max} = H_0 + \frac{v_0^2\sin^2\alpha}{2g}$.

We need this value so that we can automatically adjust the size of the window in which the animation will be shown. So, now you can start programming!

## Code development

The function first asks the user for three input parameters: target distance **S**, target height **H**, and launcher height **H0**. This allows you to accurately calculate the trajectory of movement, given that the starting angle is $45^{\circ}$ (this is the optimal angle). Next, using constants, we calculate the initial speed of the projectile at the moment of launch, as well as the maximum height of its trajectory. The value of the initial speed will be displayed on the screen for the user, and we need the maximum height in order to optimally select the size of the panel where the animation will be shown (see below).

Next, the *plt.subplots()* method creates a new figure and a set of axes. In this case, we don't specify any arguments, so the method creates one figure with one set of axes. If you specify arguments (for example, *plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2)*), a grid of figures will be created with the specified number of rows and columns. The **fig** variable contains a figure object, and the **ax** variable contains an axes set object. This is done using the unpacking mechanism in Python.

We then create an array **t** of time values, starting at 0.0 and ending with a value less than 1 (exclusively), in increments of 0.001. This array will be used as the **X** axis (abscissa) in the graph. The line *l, = plt.plot(t, t)* creates a line plot where the values on the **X** and **Y** axis correspond to the values in the **t** array. The **l** variable receives a line object (in this case, an object of type *Line2D*). We use a comma after **l** to unpack the return value of *plt.plot()* into a single variable. This makes the **l** variable a reference to a line object rather than a list of line objects.

In the line *ax.axis([0, S * 1.2, 0, Hmax * 1.4])* we set the axes values. This is where we use the distance **S** to the target and the maximum height **Hmax** of the trajectory so that the axes are automatically scaled depending on the values ‚Äã‚Äãentered by the user.

Next we create a variable, redDot, which refers to the line object representing the red dot on the graph (we again use a comma for this). The *plt.plot([0], [H0], 'ro')* function creates a point on the plot with coordinates *[0, H0]*, and the **'ro'** parameter specifies the use of **'r'** (red) for the points and the shape **'o'** (round) to display each point.

Next, we create arrays to store all the previous coordinates of the moving point. This will give us the opportunity to draw the trajectory. We then set the target coordinates and draw a stationary blue dot on the panel using the *plt.scatter()* method. This point represents the target.

The *ax.text()* function allows us to print text directly onto the panel where the animation is shown. The first two parameters set the left and top indentation, then the text is specified, which is then aligned horizontally and vertically. The **transform=ax.transAxes** parameter determines how the coordinate system will be transformed to position the text. The value **ax.transAxes** specifies the use of relative axes coordinates (0-1) instead of absolute data coordinates. Thus, coordinates (0,0) correspond to the lower left corner of the drawing area, and (1,1) correspond to the upper right corner. This allows you to easily control the placement of text regardless of the size of the graph.

The *animate()* function is responsible for animating the movement of a point along a trajectory. The **nonlocal** keyword means that the variables **previous_x** and **previous_y** will be used from the enclosing function (in this case, the function that creates the graph and calls *animate()*). The line **x = i** sets the current value of **x** to the value of **i**. In this case, **i** represents the current frame index. Using the value of **i**, the value of **y** is calculated. The line **redDot.set_data([x], [y])** sets new coordinates for the red dot in the current animation frame, these coordinates are added to the arrays of previous values so that we can draw the path using the line **l.set_data( previous_x, previous_y)**. If the **x** coordinate reaches a certain value, then the animation stops. Finally, the function returns the updated point and line objects to update the animation.

The *animation.FuncAnimation()* function from the **matplotlib.animation** library creates an animation. This function in this case takes 6 parameters:
1) **fig**, a drawing object to which the animation will be attached.
2) **animate**, a function that will be called on every animation frame to update the content.
3) **frames**, a sequence of values that will be used as an argument **i** to the *animate* function. In this case, it is an array of values from 0 to S with a step of S/300, defining the position of the point on the trajectory during the animation. The last option here allows us to automatically adjust the speed of the dot depending on the distance to the target, so that it doesn't move too fast or too slow.
4) **interval**, time interval (in milliseconds) between animation frames.
5) **blit**, this parameter specifies whether the *blitting* technique will be used to speed up the animation. If set to **True**, only changes between frames will be updated, which may improve performance.
6) **repeat**, this parameter determines whether the animation will be repeated. If set to **False**, the animation will end after one pass through all frames.

The *show()* function displays a window with current graphs.
